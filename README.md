# Online-Offline-Budget-Trackers

## Description

Budget Tracker is a progressive web application that allows users to track their budgets by adding expenses and deposits to their budget through the "Add/Subtract Funds" buttons. They are able to add a transaction with or without a connection. When a user enters a transaction while offline, these transactions are stored in the indexedDB, and transferred to the database when the user comes back online.
